# Project1: Loops and Conditional Statements
This Python project demonstrates the use of loops and conditional statements.

## Console-Based ATM Simulation in Python

This Python project simulates a **console-based ATM system**. It demonstrates the use of **loops**, **conditional statements**, and **dictionaries** to manage user accounts and transactions.

---

## Features
- User authentication with **account number and PIN**
- **Withdraw** money from account
- **Deposit** money into account
- **Balance enquiry**
- **PIN change**
- **Mini statement** of last 3 transactions
- **Exit** option

## Users Data
The program uses a **dictionary** to store user accounts in the format:
account_number : [name, balance, pin]
Example:
'62433570421': ['Reena', 3000, 1234]

**How to Run**
Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
Clone the repository or download the file.
Open terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder, and run:
python "project1 - loops and conditional statement.py"
Follow the on-screen instructions to log in and perform transactions.


**Notes**
You have 3 attempts to enter the correct PIN.
The program stores transactions in a list for the mini statement.
Only valid inputs are accepted for transactions and PIN changes.
