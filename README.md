# Project1: Loops and Conditional Statements
This Python project demonstrates the use of loops and conditional statements.

## Console-Based ATM Simulation in Python

This Python project simulates a **console-based ATM system**. It demonstrates the use of **loops**, **conditional statements**, and **dictionaries** to manage user accounts and transactions.

---

## Features
- User authentication with **account number and PIN**
- **Withdraw** money from account
- **Deposit** money into account
- **Balance enquiry**
- **PIN change**
- **Mini statement** of last 3 transactions
- **Exit** option

---

## Users Data

The program uses a **dictionary** to store user accounts in the format:

account_number : [name, balance, pin]
Example: '62433570421': ['Reena', 3000, 1234]


### ðŸ§©How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.  
2. Clone the repository or download the file.  
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder.  
4. Run the following command:
    python "project1 - loops and conditional statement.py"
5.Follow the on-screen instructions to log in and perform transactions

**Notes**
You have 3 attempts to enter the correct PIN.
The program stores transactions in a list for the mini statement.
Only valid inputs are accepted for transactions and PIN changes.
